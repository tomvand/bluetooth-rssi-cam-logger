# bluetooth-rssi-cam-logger

## rssi_logger
Simple logger that records RSSI values, displays a graph and calculates basic statistics (mean, variance).

## bluetooth_cam_logger
A more advanced logger that records RSSI values and webcam images over a longer period of time. Used for 24 hour recording of the environment. Stores all results in a timestamped folder. Zip this folder after the recording is completed to use it with log_viewer.

Logger settings are currently hardcoded in the python file, see the 'default configuration' section.

## log_viewer
Tool to view the logs generated by bluetooth_cam_logger. See 'log_viewer.py --help' for more information.
